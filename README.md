# Flood_prediction_kaggle

This repo is used as part of the [Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/overview) Kaggle contest.

## Setup

- **Step 1:** Create a conda environment with `python 3.11.4`

```
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11.4
```
Replace `<env_name>` with a name for the conda environment

- **Step 2:** Activate your new conda environment and execute the below command to install all the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Now you are ready to run any notebook or script file in this repository

## Dataset description

- Original dataset [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijlaldhankour/flood-prediction-factors)
- As mentioned in the contest page, the dataset used below is generated by DL model trained on original source

## Analysis

### ML models

Since this is a simple regression-problem with 21 input variables and 1 output variable, we try the following classical ML models

| MODEL | EXPLAINED VARIANCE | R<sup>2</sup>-SCORE | MODEL SCORE | REMARKS |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Linear Regression (LR) | 0.843419 | 0.843419 | 0.845328 | - |
| Support Vector Regression (SVR) | 0.713246 | 0.663578 | 0.665758 | Tried out for different values of `max_iterations` and chose `max_iterations=600` |
| Random Forest Regression (RF) | 0.637372 | 0.637181 | 0.941959 | Tried out different values of `n_estimators` and since increase in score wasn't significant went ahead with `n_estimators=25` and `max_depth=30` |
| Ensemble (LR + SVR + RF) | 0.812664 | 0.809666 | 0.888136 | Tried ensemble of the above three models with weights (`1.5`,`1.0`,`1.25`) chosen based on comparative performance - but ensemble doesn't beat Linear Regression |

### DL models

Just as an experiment we try the following Fully Connected Network Architectures to see if we get better performance than Linear Regression.
